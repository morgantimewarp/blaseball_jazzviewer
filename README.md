# blaseball_jazzviewer
A translator for turning blaseball into jazz, baby.

# Features
Each team is assigned to a key, currently at random.

Game events are translated into a saxophone line on either a jazz minor scale, or a bebop major scale. Range: C#3 - C5

The current pitcher determines the chords being played on the piano - it cycles through the letters in their name, with each letter in the alphabet having a chord assigned to them. Range: C2-C6

## Also included
A hand-rendered mockup of what it should sound like, and a PDF of the score for that mockup, for the bottom of this game: https://reblase.sibr.dev/game/5efd94fd-875f-423e-a47f-cc464d5684e6

The number of baserunners determines the rhythmic pattern of the upright bass, playing the same chord as the piano. Range: C2-C6

# TODO: 
implement sound, duh. But I implemented the music theory successfully!

implement timing within game events

make it into an applet/window with dropdown menus to select the game instead of having to modify the source code to select the game id LMAO
send out a survey to ask teams what key they think they should be
